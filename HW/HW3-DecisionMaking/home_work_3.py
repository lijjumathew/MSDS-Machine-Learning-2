    # Problem 2 - Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column index.
    transform_restaurant_matrix()

    # Problem 3 - The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.
    # Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.
    # Answer 3 - Linear combination is a concept in linear algebra where you multiple 2 vectors together (element wise)
    # to obtain a new vector and then sum up the elements of this new vector to get an aggregate number.
    # The way it applies to our problem is that we have a rating for each resturant in particular categories and
    # each person has also given their preference for those same categories. Hence by multiplying the preferences and
    # ratings appropriately and summing them up, we can get an aggregate score for that person for a particular
    # resturant. This is especially helpful since now we dont have to have every person rate every resturant
    # individually. All they have to do is provide their preferences and based on how the resturant scores on those
    # preferences, we can obtain an aggretae score easily.

    # Problem 4 - Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.
    # What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.
    # Answer 4 - This method gives a users preferences for each of the restaurants in the survey.

        print('\t', rest, ": ", score)

    # Problem 4 - Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.
    # What does the a_ij matrix represent?
    # Answer 4 - The output of this matrix represents the user score for each user on each restaurant.

        print('\t', rest, ": ", score)

    # Problem 5 -Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.
    # What do the entryâ€™s represent?

    # for the whole group (the restaurant with the highest score will be the most prefered to the group)
    calculate_all_user_prefs()

    # Problem 6 - Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.

    # Problem 7 - Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?
    # What does represent in the real world?How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.
    # Answer 7 - Summing all of the scores using method 1 allows one person's preferences to dominate the
    # overall score because that one person may strongly favor a particular resturant.
    # By making the scores non-parametric (adding the ranks of each resturant instead of their raw scores) by method 2,
    # Each participant's rank vote is counted equally.  The result in my survey is that the same places are chosen
    # for first and last by the group, but the other ranks are jumbled by using this diffirent method.
    # Both methods may have their value in the real world, using method 2 is more likley to result in the group
    # going to a place that most people like; while a single person could feel very strongly against it.
    # Method 1 is more likley to result in the group going to a place which most participants do not have
    # a strong opinion of; while a single person may have a very strong preference toward that place.
    # In other words, using a non-parametric system makes it harder for a single person to manipulate the
    # system toward a specific preference. It could be possible to reduce the impact of agressive users by
    # applying weights to the preferences matrix.

    # Problem 10 - Should you split in two groups today?
    # Answer 10 - These two methods give very diffirent values, but in both cases, the most highly ranked resturant
    # of both methods is gievn a disastisfaction index.  Using the numeric index, the most highly ranked restaurant ,
    # gets the highest disastisfaction index. Since this method takes into effect how much a person disslikes a place,
    # those that do not want to go to Pink Door, seem to very much be against the idea.
    # This lends some credibility to the arguement that lunch should be split into multipule groups.

    # Now what is best restaurant?

    # Problem 12 - Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal
    # ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their weight matrix?
    # Answer 12 - No, I cant find their weight matrix just based on their preferences.  This is because unrecoverable
    # information is lost when converting the output from the restaurant scores matrix to group ranks, but i could
    # find the weight matrix if I was given each participant's score for each resturaunt.  This is because matrix
    # multiplication is reversable.
